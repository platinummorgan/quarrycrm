- Deep link documentation in tour
- localStorage-based tour state

### 6. Security & SEO

## üì¶ Deployment Status

### Git Status
```
Commit: 57a0310
Branch: main
Status: Pushed to origin/main
```

### Vercel Auto-Deploy
Vercel is configured to automatically deploy when changes are pushed to `main`. The deployment should be processing now.

**Monitor deployment at:**
- https://vercel.com/michaels-projects-4c786e88/quarrycrm

### Build Configuration
- Next.js 14.2.5
- Middleware size: 48.6 kB
- Dynamic routes properly configured
- Static optimization where possible

## üß™ Post-Deployment Testing

### Manual Tests to Perform

1. **Query Parameter Routing:**
   ```
   Visit: https://[your-domain]/app/contacts?open=[contact-id]
   Expected: Contact drawer opens automatically
   
   Visit: https://[your-domain]/app/deals?focus=[deal-id]
   Expected: Deal card is focused and scrolled into view
   
   Visit: https://[your-domain]/app/deals?pipeline=[pipeline-id]&focus=[deal-id]
   Expected: Pipeline selected, then deal focused
   ```

2. **Demo Features:**
   ```
   - Access /demo endpoint
   - Sign in as demo user
   - Verify tour appears for new users
   - Test PII masking on contacts/deals
   - Test rate limiting (make rapid API calls)
   - Verify export is disabled
   ```

3. **SEO/Robots:**
   ```
   Visit: https://[your-domain]/robots.txt
   Expected: Proper directives for your environment
   
   Check headers: X-Robots-Tag should be present in non-prod
   ```

4. **Debug Features:**
   ```
   Visit: https://[your-domain]/api/whoami
   Expected: Returns user info with proper cache headers
   
   Check for debug header pill in UI
   ```

## üîç Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

These warnings appear during build but are expected:
- Dynamic routes using `headers()` cannot be statically rendered
- Routes affected: `/api/workspace`, `/api/organizations/*`, `/demo`
- This is intentional behavior for authenticated/dynamic routes

## üìä Bundle Sizes

```
First Load JS shared by all: 87.2 kB
Middleware: 48.6 kB

Largest pages:
- /app/deals: 195 kB
- /contacts: 204 kB
- /app/companies: 185 kB
- /app/contacts: 185 kB
```

## üöÄ Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Verify deployment succeeded** on Vercel dashboard
2. **Run smoke tests** on production URL
3. **Test query parameter routing** with real data
4. **Monitor error logs** for the first hour
5. **Test demo user flow** end-to-end
6. **Verify rate limiting** doesn't affect normal users

## üìù Environment Variables to Check

Make sure these are set in Vercel:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Postgres connection
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Auth secret
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Production URL
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection (if using rate limiting)
- `DEMO_SECRET` - Demo user token secret
